        <h1 class="header">what i'm doing now.</h1>
        <p class="content-p">I'm in Mount Vernon, NY keeping it simple and dynamic. Working from anywhere but you can usually catch me at the nearby Barnes & Noble or Bryant Park (wifi is surprisingly strong & make sure you got a VPN). Life is life-ing right now, but we take the crookeds with the straights gratuitiously.</p>
        <h3 class="hobby-subhead">Journaling: A Lot</h3>
        <p>I have about 10 notebooks/journals in rotation right now. All serving some kind of purpose. I got a lot in my head and good pens.</p>
        <h3 class="hobby-subhead">Meditation: </h3>
        <p>Keystone habit here. Trying out a few apps. Am I going to have to pay for one of them?</p>
        <h3 class="hobby-subhead">Reading: <a href="http://" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Letting Go</a> </h3>
        <p>Been working through this good. It's been good for me. Helping me work on letting go of the past, frustrating situations and negative emotions. I'm reading some other books too, check the GoodReads profile. </p>
        <h3 class="sub-head">Fitness: Mount Vernon Barbell </h3>
        <p>Implementing the conjugate method into my routine. The summer wasn't really my best effort in the gym. Looking to at least finish the 4th quarter strong and rebuilt my strength and physique. Maybe next summer I'll provide the goods.</p>
        <h3 class="sub-head">Learning: Stock Market & Mental Health </h3>
        <p>Slowly getting back into trading stocks. Starting slow and being patient. Summer whooped my ass mentally and I need to get back in check. Journaling, meditation, maybe therapy, maybe alternative medicine. I'm looking into it all. It's imperative for me to my mental back in check. Wish me well.</p>
        <h3 class="sub-head">Photography: Sunday FunDays </h3>
        <p>I started a photography IG page. Not sharing it yet. But a Sunday ritual I'm building is going to the city for a few hours and shooting. Last Sunday I rode the train to 125th with the goal to walk to Bryant Park but the heat was a bit hectic. I made to 86th, jumped on a Subway and grabbed some Vietnamese Iced Coffee from Le Phin. I shot alittle more but then took my sweaty ass home.</p>
        <h3 class="sub-head">Listening: <a href="https://music.apple.com/profile/weezek" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple Music</a>  </h3>
        <p>I love vibing out to music. I love finding new/old music. I love Shazamming. I'm a professional Shazammer. Currently just discovered Open Eagle Mike, an underground artist that I'm digging.</p>
