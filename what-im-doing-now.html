        <h1 class="header">what i'm doing now.</h1>
        <p class="content-p">I'm in Mount Vernon, NY keeping it simple and dynamic.</p>
        <h3 class="hobby-subhead">Journaling: A Lot</h3>
        <p>Journaling has always been a main stay for me. During the good and not so good times. It one of my core activities that grounds me and helps me work through all the open tabs in my brain.</p>
        <h3 class="hobby-subhead">Meditation: </h3>
        <p>Sitting. Laying Down. Walking. Been very deliberate being present and using meditation to get to a place of being.</p>
        <h3 class="hobby-subhead">Reading: <a href="http://" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Art of Communicating and Clear Thinking</a> </h3>
        <p>I follow Shane Parrish and read his blog from time to time. The information he shares is very insightful. If 2023 has taught me anything it's that not learning how to communicate will always result in something catastrophic happening. I'm learning this lesson in real time and so now I have to begin improving. Thich Nhat Hanh provides a spiritual approach to communication which has been helpful. Eventually I will venture to find a more practical technique based type of book to supplement what I've learned from Thich Nhat Hanh.</p>
        <h3 class="sub-head">Fitness: Mount Vernon Barbell </h3>
        <p></p>
        <h3 class="sub-head">Learning: JavaScript & Mental Health Practices </h3>
        <p>Trying my hardest to get a firm understanding of JavaScript. I'm also in therapy now. To supplement my therapy session, I'm learning more about other theraputic exercises to heal.</p>
        <h3 class="sub-head">Photography: Sunday FunDays </h3>
        <p>I started a photography IG page. But a Sunday ritual I'm building is going to the city for a few hours and shooting. Last Sunday I rode the train to 125th with the goal to walk to Bryant Park but the heat was a bit hectic. I made to 86th, jumped on a Subway and grabbed some Vietnamese Iced Coffee from Le Phin. I shot alittle more but then took my sweaty ass home.</p>
        <h3 class="sub-head">Listening: <a href="https://music.apple.com/profile/weezek" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple Music</a>  </h3>
        <p>I love vibing out to music. I love finding new/old music. I love Shazamming. I'm a professional Shazammer. Currently just discovered Open Mike Eagle, an underground artist that I'm digging.</p>
